Codecrafters challenge https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/

Finished 3.1.2025.

On that I have expanded adding multithreading and compression support.

This was interesting learning experience, definitelly it was somehow easier than the Shell challenge. But I think that the Shell challenge kinda helped me out with this.
